    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>"Parfait" does mean "perfect" in French, which is very fitting, because these frozen yogurt parfaits are perfectly easy, and are a perfect make-ahead frozen summer treat.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups raspberries, rinsed and drained</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup blueberries, rinsed and drained</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups granola</li>
        <li>2 cups full-fat plain Greek yogurt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine raspberries and ½ cup white sugar in a bowl. Crush with a potato masher into a puree. Cover and let sit out for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Pass berry puree through a fine mesh strainer to remove seeds. Add blueberries, stir, and keep in the refrigerator until needed.</li>
        <li>Whisk yogurt, vanilla, lemon zest, and sugar for frozen yogurt together in a bowl until sugar dissolves and the mixture is light and fluffy. Transfer into a piping bag and refrigerate until needed.</li>
        <li>Add 2 tablespoons of granola into an 8-ounce jar, or similar vessel. Top with 2 tablespoons of the fruit mixture. Try to make sure some of the fruit sauce is touching the glass so you can see the layers when frozen. Top with 2 heaping tablespoons of the yogurt mixture. Repeat twice more for a total of 3 layers. Top can be garnished with any remaining fruit and sauce.</li>
        <li>Freeze until frozen solid, about 8 hours, or overnight.</li>
    </ol>
