        <li>2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>2 lemons, juiced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium mixing bowl, beat cream cheese until fluffy. Add condensed milk, lemon juice, and lemon rind. Mix until smooth. Pour mixture into crust. Refrigerate at least 2 hours before serving. Garnish with whipped cream and mint leaves if desired.</li>
